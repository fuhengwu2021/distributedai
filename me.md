我有直接work on分布式的经验，对sglang相关项目比如genai-bench有直接贡献比如https://github.com/sgl-project/genai-bench/pull/115 , 和微软的联合blog https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/15/high-performance-deep-learning-in-oracle-cloud-with-onnx-runtime

Hi Henry, 
It was a pleasure speaking with you today - thank you again for sharing your valuable insights! 😊
We’re genuinely excited about the opportunity to collaborate with you. With your experience and deep expertise, we’re confident your contribution will help shape a compelling and practical book for our readers.
As discussed, we wanted to quickly summarize the direction we’re exploring and share the next steps:
Topic - Distributed Systems with AI (we can work on a better title)
Outline Creation:
Our first key milestone is the outline - your roadmap for the book.
To support you:
We’ve shared a sample outline from one of our recent books on Quantum Computing Algorithms for reference - Quantum Computing Algorithms - Google Docs
You’ll also find a custom outline template here: Blank Outline Template_PI&Outline_Henry - Google Docs- a fill-in-the-blank format designed to simplify and accelerate the process.
Once you complete the outline, our editorial team will review it and share feedback to strengthen the structure and flow. Once finalized, we’ll move to the contracting phase.
A strong outline typically takes about 6-7 days to draft. We usually recommend 10–15 chapters of 25–30 pages each - balancing depth with readability, while focusing on implementation and practical guidance. 
Editorial Process:
Once the outline is approved:
We’ll proceed with the publishing contract and define a chapter delivery schedule.
Our team handles layout, proofreading, graphics, and cover design - so you can stay focused on content.
Advances and Royalties:
We offer:
16% royalties on net receipts
Additionally, we provide advance against royalties, paid in installments throughout the writing phase (starting after outline approval)
Marketing Reach:
Your book will be distributed globally through 40+ sellers, including:
Amazon, O'Reilly, Apple Safari, and Barnes & Noble
Plus visibility on www.packt.com, which reaches 500K+ active tech readers
Contracting Phase:
Following outline approval, we’ll share a standard author contract for you to review. A sample contract is attached for reference - feel free to reach out with any questions.
Looking forward to working with you - and once again, thank you for your enthusiasm and thoughtful inputs!
Warm regards,
Rithika Shetty

Hi Rithika/Kunal,

Thanks again for the great discussion yesterday. Before I move into the outline, I’d like to confirm a couple of key points regarding the book structure and topic direction.

Co-author option
As we discussed during the call, I may bring in a co-author for certain sections. Could you please confirm that this is fully supported and let me know if there is a formal process for adding a co-author before or after outline approval?

Refined topic direction
I would like to propose a more focused and industry-relevant direction for the book.
My preferred scope would center around modern distributed AI systems, including:

• Distributed training at scale (DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed, topology-aware GPU strategies)
• Distributed inference (vLLM, SGLang, DeepSeek-style architectures)
• Serving and deployment using Kubernetes (GPU scheduling, autoscaling, production hosting)
• Cloud implementations and examples on AWS or OCI

This topic aligns closely with my background and public contributions:
• I have hands-on experience working on distributed training and inference systems in production.
• I contributed to SGLang-related projects, such as genai-bench (PR #115).
• I co-authored a Microsoft + Oracle Cloud joint blog on high-performance deep learning with ONNX Runtime.

Given this background, I believe this refined direction would produce a highly practical and impactful book for practitioners.

Before I proceed with the outline, I wanted to confirm that Packt is open to adjusting the topic and title to fit this expanded distributed training / inference / benchmarking / serving scope.

Once I hear back from you, I’ll finalize the outline accordingly.

Warm regards,
Henry

Hi Henry,

For co-author yes, we can onboard one. We will need the Linkedin profile and brief bio of the co-author as they will also need to sign a contract. You and the co-author can decide how the royalty and compensation will be split depending on your contribution and let us know, mostly we do pro-rata basis.

Regarding the topic area, yes, it’s fine to take the direction you are proposing, once you share the outline it will help us understand the direction and scope. So yes you can start with the same.

One question we have is whether you are planning a broad AI systems or narrow the focus on LLM applications?

Kind regards,
Rithika
