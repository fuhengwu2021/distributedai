Long description

(1350 characters)

With large AI models now reaching billions of parameters, distributed systems have become essential for training and serving modern AI. Most resources focus on theory, leaving practitioners struggling to implement production-ready solutions. This book bridges that gap with hands-on, production-ready code for every major distributed AI technology.

The book begins with resource estimation and decision frameworks, then dives into GPU hardware architecture, high-speed interconnect technologies, and parallelism strategies. You'll learn distributed training techniques including data parallelism for single and multi-node setups, parameter sharding for memory-efficient training, and memory optimization strategies for massive models.

The second part focuses on distributed inference and production deployment. You'll build high-performance inference systems using advanced attention mechanisms, KV cache management, operator fusion techniques, and router-based architectures. You'll deploy on cluster schedulers and container orchestration platforms with GPU scheduling, and create complete production serving stacks with tokenizer services, API gateways, distributed tracing, canary deployments, and observability.

The final section covers rigorous benchmarking methodologies, performance optimization techniques, and emerging trends including MoE architectures, edge-cloud coordination, and advanced parallelism strategies. Every chapter includes production-ready code examples tested on real infrastructure, debugging guides, and performance optimization strategies.

By the end of the book, you'll be equipped to build production distributed AI systems that scale from single nodes to large clusters, whether you're training billion-parameter models or serving them to millions of users.
