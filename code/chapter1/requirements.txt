# Requirements for Chapter 1: Introduction to Modern Distributed AI
# 
# Core dependencies for distributed training examples

# PyTorch with CUDA support
# Note: Install PyTorch according to your CUDA version from https://pytorch.org
# Example for CUDA 11.8:
# torch>=2.0.0
# Or install via: pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# For CUDA 12.1:
# pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Standard library dependencies (included with Python, listed for reference)
# - os
# - time
# - subprocess
# - sys

# PyTorch ecosystem (usually included with PyTorch)
# - torch.distributed (NCCL backend for multi-GPU)
# - torch.nn
# - torch.optim
# - torch.utils.data
# - torch.profiler

# Optional: For Hugging Face Accelerate (if using Option 3 in notebook)
# accelerate>=0.20.0

# Jupyter notebook support (for running 1.ipynb)
jupyter>=1.0.0
ipykernel>=6.0.0

# Note: NCCL is typically included with PyTorch CUDA builds
# Make sure you have compatible CUDA drivers and toolkit installed
